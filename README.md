## Account Setup

Start by setting up an Azure account, which involves a simple process. Initially, you'll need to provide your credentials and later, it will prompt you to enter your credit card details. Rest assured, as you'll be signing up for a free account. Once you complete this process, you'll be ready to proceed further.

### Great!

Before deploying the application, the first step is to create a "Resource Group."

On the homepage, locate the search bar at the top and enter "Resource Group." From the search results, select the "Resource Group" option.
